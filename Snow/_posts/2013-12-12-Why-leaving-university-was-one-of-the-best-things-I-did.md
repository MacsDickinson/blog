![I Regret Nothing ][0]

I didn't do too well at university. For some reason I decided to take a music course that was mostly theory. I'm a drummer - theory isn't my strong point.

I grew up in rural Wales - [Brecon][1] - where computer science isn't at the forefront of peoples minds. The local high school only offered the traditional subjects (I opted for Maths, Chemistry and Music) and for the more adventurous there was a local collage offering a BTec in masonry amongst other things.

It wasn't until I left Brecon that I really started to get to know the true magnitude of the options that were available to me and after a painful year of theory I decided to call it a day. In hindsight this is when I should have signed up for a CS degree but 19 year old me was yet to discover programming. Instead I did what any self respecting drop out would have done - I got a job in a call centre. One thing led to another and a year or so later I was doing semi-technical file processing for a translation company. This was as dull as it sounds but it taught me a number of valuable things:

# RegEx - whether this is a blessing or a hindrance I am yet to find out but for over a year I RegExed the crap out of those files.
# C# - There is only so far you can go with a find and replace. My boss at the time had introduced me to LinqPad so went out and got myself a C# book.
# PM's - We often focus our efforts on really getting to know the frameworks and languages we use but what use is this if we cannot convey that knowledge to someone who doesn't already know it?

The next thing I know I've been promoted and I'm writing C# code for a living! Fast forward a year and I'm a full blown Software Developer!

That was three years ago and is not the point of this post.

Since then I have always felt somewhat lacking compared to my honoured peers and have gone out of my way learn new techniques, frameworks and standards. It is this underlying insecurity that one day my employers will turn around and say "wait a minute - you don't have a degree" that pushes me to consistently push myself to my limit.

I'm interested to see what other people in the industry think to this, especially those who have the degrees and can see it from the other side. Do you think there is a clear difference between the educated and the self taught developer? What are the pro's and con's?
