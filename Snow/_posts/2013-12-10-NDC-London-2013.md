Last week around six hundred and fifty developers decended upon London's ExCeL center for the 'new DevelopersConference();' The conference ran all week with workshops running Monday and Tuesday and talks running the remainder of the week. I wasn't luck enough to make it down to the workshops but here is what I learnt from the talks.

Wednesday
=========

Keynote - Jackstones: The Journy to Mastery - [Dan North][0]
------------------------------------------------------------

Dan opened the talks with a keynote around craftsmanship and mastery and told the story of the traditional journy from apprentice to journyman to master. He then applied this same approach to software development explaining the different stages of of peoples careers. There were a couple of take home messages in this talk for me; never stop learning and if there is someone who is in the position you want to get to then try to mimic what they do.

Async in C# 5 - [Jon Skeet][1]
------------------------------

Once I had gotten over the initial shock that [with a mustache][2] Jon Skeet looks significantly like a young [Michael Palin][3] I started to see what was new for async in C# 5. This talk was all about async and await so Jon took us through a number of examples which demonstrated well the different approaches and the limitations of these.

Scripting your web API development using scriptcs - [Glenn Block][4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------



This is one of those techonologies that I've seen all over the place but haven't really taken the time to get to know what it is for. [Daniel Roth][1]'s talk [ASP.Net and OWIN - Better Together][2] introduced me to the basics of OWIN and Microsofts take on the standard, [Katana][2]. In essance OWIN (Open Web Interface for .NET) is a standard that defines the interface between .NET web servers and applications. What this enables is the simple application of middleware in the applications pipeline.
