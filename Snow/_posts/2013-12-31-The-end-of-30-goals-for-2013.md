title: The end of 30 things for 2013

2013 has been a very productive year. It's seen a new job, a house move, the birth of this blog, a couple of talks, the loss of a laptop and a couple of conferences. Not all of these were forseen but a number of them were down to the goals I set myself at the beginning of the year. I haven't completed everything I set out to do but I do think that giving myself these clear objectives has pushed me to get more out of 2013 than I otherwise would have done. Being self motivated isn't only important for the self employed, it's also important to motivate yourself outside of work if you want to improve. Giving yourself a clear set of goals to complete in a set time is a garenteed way to squeez more out of your year. Here's how I got on:

Completed
---------

* **Enrol in a technical course** - I have started (but never got around to finishing) the [HTML5 Game Development][1] course with [Udacity][2]. It is actually  fantastic course and I highly recommended it for anyone who wants to improve their vanilla javascript scills.
* **Eat something I've never eaten before** - This will have been completed on numerous occasions. I officially crossed it off the list after eating a treat broughta collegue brought back from India.
* **1 month without alcohol** - January was totally dry and it was great. This is something I am going to try to do more often.
