title: 2014 - Time for some new goals
published: draft
---

Last year I set myself the relatively ambitious target of completing 30 goals in 2013. Whilst I didn't complete all of them I did achieve a lot and I found it great motivation so this year I'm scaling it back a bit and setting myself less - but maybe more challenging - goals.

14 goals for 2014
===========

Lifestyle
---------

1. Walk 1,000,000 steps
2. Do the great north run
3. Take my wife on a date every week
4. 31 days without alcohol
5. Buy a house
6. Drink 100 different beers
7. Play at a gig


Tech
-----

8. Talk at a conference
9. Author my own OSS project
10. Learn a new programming language
11. Become a main contributor to a large OSS project
12. Make money from a product
13. Blog every fortnight
14. Get StackOverflow score to over 1,000

Here's to a productive 2014!
